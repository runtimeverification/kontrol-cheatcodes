# Kontrol Cheatcodes

Kontrol cheatcodes complement [Foundry's cheatcodes](https://book.getfoundry.sh/cheatcodes/) to enhance the expressivity of your symbolic specifications even further. With these cheatcodes, you can, for instance, make the storage of a given address symbolic, create new symbolic values, or expect that no further calls are made.

Check out our [Kontrol documentation](https://docs.runtimeverification.com/kontrol/overview/readme) to start writing and executing symbolic tests for your project!
